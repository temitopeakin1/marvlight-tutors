# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/marv.png
   - assets/images/tutorhome.jpg
   - assets/images/tutorhome1.jpg
   - assets/icons/study.png
   - assets/icons/shield.png
   - assets/icons/class.png
   - assets/icons/excellence.png
   - assets/icons/mclass.png
   - assets/icons/reading.png
   - assets/icons/tutor.png
 

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see((99
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
        
    - family: JosefinSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-MediumItalic.ttf
    
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
        
    - family: Comic Sans 
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/ComicSansMS3.ttf
